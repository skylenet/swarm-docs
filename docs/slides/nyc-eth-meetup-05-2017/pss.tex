  \begin{itemize}
   \item kademlia overlay topology for deterministic message routing
   \item incentivised message relay (store requests sent towards non-content address must be paid for)
   \item deterministic routing and message delivery
   \item priority queues
   \item insured storage
   \item certified delivery by receipts
   \item multicast broadcast
  \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{How does information (dynamic content) move around?}
Using the same routing and incentive system as storage and retrieval.

 \begin{itemize}
    \item status updates (public or restricted)
    \item chatroom, discussion forum, QnA forum

    \item audio-video broadcast, tv, radio, podcast (live or recorded)

    \item file transfer, download
    \item datastreams, feeds, message bus

\begin{block}<2->{Question:}
 Why are these services provided by private entities and are not part of the basic public infrastructure? After all, everything is just pulling, pushing and storing data.
